# Color
A very simple color picker app
This app lets you pick the perfect color for your website/application/software.
There are three sliders that you can shift representing values of Red, Green, and Blue.
The color value will show up in the right corer as RGB to default.
You can click the hexadecimal tab which will convert the sliders to a Hex value instead of RGB.
Click on the values to copy them to your clipboard.
